Chore Wheel
===========

**ðŸ”† Chore Wheel** is pioneering software for coliving, built by Zaratan and running on Slack.

Created by **economists** and **game designers**, Chore Wheel is a family of tools helping people share space:

- :ref:`chores` for keeping it clean
- :ref:`hearts` for mutual accountability
- :ref:`things` for bulk purchasing
- and more to come

Chore Wheel is **open-source** and **privacy-preserving**, and contains the latest thinking in **ethical technology**.
Chore Wheel draws influences variously from **cognitive science, computer science, electoral theory, economics, cybernetics, and game design**, with four top-level :ref:`design principles <design-principles>`:

- No managers or privileged administrative roles
- Simple and intuitive inputs
- Humans for sensing and judgment, machines for bookkeeping
- Continuously available, asynchronous processes

Groups using Chore Wheel find that they spend **less time doing chores**, **less time talking about chores**, and **less time worrying about their house in general**.
Check out the :ref:`introduction <introduction>` for a more detailed overview of the project, or our :ref:`getting started guide <getting-started>` to get set up for yourself.
