Chore Wheel
===========

**ðŸ”† Chore Wheel** is pioneering software for coliving, helping communities thrive.

Created by **coliving veterans** and **game designers**, Chore Wheel is a family of **Slack apps** helping people share space:

- :ref:`chores` for keeping it clean
- :ref:`hearts` for mutual accountability
- :ref:`things` for bulk purchasing
- And more to come...

Designed for **intentional communities**, **casual roommates**, **cohabitating partners**, and everything in-between, Chore Wheel helps people share the **emotional and mental labor** of sustaining communities.
Groups using Chore Wheel have **fewer meetings** and **less conflict**, leaving more time for what really matters.

**The best part? It's very easy to use.**
