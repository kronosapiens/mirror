Mirror
======

**Mirror is pioneering software for co-living, running on Slack.**

Created by **economists** and **game designers**, Mirror is a family of tools helping people share space:

- :ref:`chores` for keeping it clean
- :ref:`hearts` for mutual accountability
- :ref:`things` for bulk purchasing
- and more to come

Mirror is **open-source** and **privacy-preserving**.
It contains the latest thinking in **ethical technology**, with four core principles:

- No managers or privileged roles
- Simple and intuitive inputs
- Humans decide, machines bookkeep
- Always-on, asynchronous processes

Check out the :ref:`introduction` for a more detailed overview of the project, or :ref:`getting-started` to get set up for yourself.

.. note::

  This project is under active development, and has been supported by the **Open-Source Software** (2x), **Governance Research**, and **Metacrisis** rounds of `Gitcoin Grants <https://grants.gitcoin.co/>`_.
