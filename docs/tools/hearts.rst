Hearts
======

Introduction
------------

Every community begins with the best of intentions.
And every community, invariably, experiences conflict.
Experiencing conflict is not a choice.
How we deal with it, however, is.

We could choose to ignore conflict, letting it build and fester until communal bonds are permanently damaged.
We could choose to escape responsibility, giving away our power and agency to an authority figure who promises to make our problems go away, but never really does.
Or we could choose to face conflict head-on, engaging in the essential relational processes which lead to fulfilling long-term adult relationships.

Hearts is an accountability tool, used to help structure the experience and resolution of conflict.
Hearts is designed with two goals in mind: first, to give members of a community meaningful tools for holding each other accountable; second, to emphasize communication and repair over judgment and punishment.

Functionality
-------------

The core concept of Hearts is, unsurprisingly, **hearts**.
Everyone starts with five hearts, and gains and loses them as the result of various processes.
Having more hearts means that you are effectively upholding the commitments you've made.
Having fewer hearts means you are not.
The more hearts the better.
Losing all your hearts is bad.

Challenges
~~~~~~~~~~

The most dramatic way to lose a heart is by having another resident call you out for bad behavior, by issuing a **challenge** (similar to getting a "strike").
This, rightly, is an uncomfortable experience, but a necessary one, as the final step in the :ref:`conflict-resolution` process.
If you couldn't be called out, or you couldn't call someone else out, then there would be no accountability: problematic behavior would continue until things reached a breaking point; not a situation anyone wants to be in.
By issuing and receiving challenges, we create a structure for engaging proactively with conflict.

Anyone can issue a challenge, stating a number of hearts they think you should lose (up to three), and their reasoning.
The issue then goes to a vote.
If you lose, you lose hearts.
If your challenger loses, they lose hearts.
As a way to prevent abuse, a challenger needs a *minimum* of 40% of the house to support them to win, otherwise they lose by default.
If losing the challenge will leave you with one heart (or none), then they need the support of at least 70% of the house.

It is very unlikely someone would challenge you arbitrarily, as they are strongly disincentivize from doing so.
Anyone who issues a challenge stands to lose hearts themselves, if other residents feel they are out of line.
Instead, challenges should come as no surprise, and represent a final step in a respectful process of disagreement.

Regeneration
~~~~~~~~~~~~

It is said that time heals all wounds.
Whether or not that is true is a question for psychologists and philosophers.
What we can say with confidence is that time restores lost hearts.
Specifically, a half-heart per month, for everybody, always.
This is how we center rehabilitation over punishment.
If you lose a heart for whatever reason, integrate the lesson, and soon enough it will be forgotten.
Hearts regeneration will only take you back to the five-heart baseline.
If you already have five hearts, you don't get more.

Karma
~~~~~

Much of Hearts is about handling conflict.
But what about all the good things that happen, which are in all likelihood the majority of the interactions occurring among the residents? For that we have **karma**.
Anyone can give karma to another resident by adding a "plus-plus" (``++``) after their name.
Every month, all the karma is added together, and the resident with the most karma gets a bonus heart, on top of the half-heart that everyone gets.
Even more, you can get a karma heart even if you have a full five hearts, giving you an epic **six** or even **seven** hearts.
