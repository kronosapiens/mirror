Things
======

Introduction
------------

There's an old line that "organizations are communities with resources".
One of the economic benefits of living in community is the opportunity to buy supplies more cheaply, in bulk.
Rather than 12 tiny bottles of olive oil, all crowding each other on the shelf, we can have one large (and less expensive) bottle.
Examples abound.

Things is a spending tool, letting residents in a house spend out of a shared account, using their own judgment (within limits) on what should be purchased.

Functionality
-------------

Compared to :ref:`Chores` and :ref:`Hearts`, Things is simple.
There is a list of items that the house can buy: things like toilet paper, olive oil, rice, and the like, generally sold in bulk.
There is an amount of money currently available, the "House Account".
And at any time, anyone can propose the house buy something from the list.

Buy
~~~

Whenever someone notices that a supply is running low, they can propose that the house buy more.
The "buy" is then posted publicly, and other residents can endorse or reject the proposal.
A minimum of **one endorsement per $50** is needed for the buy to succeed, to prevent one person from unilaterally spending a large proportion of the house's funds.
To buy $30 worth of olive oil, only one endorsement is needed, that of the proposer.
To order a $200 house cleaning, on the other hand, a minimum of four endorsements are required.

Once a buy is resolved, it will be "fulfilled" (hand-wavy, to be sure) in some way, shape, or form.
