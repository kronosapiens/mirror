Monthly Circle
==============

.. epigraph::

  Ostromâ€™s `seminal work <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elinor_Ostrom>`_ on shared governance (i.e. self-governance) demonstrated that effective regulatory systems often include educational, co-managerial, rehabilitative, and participatory decision-making components designed to maintain positive, long-term relationships.

The **monthly circle** is a simple and accessible practice used to pro-actively cultivate shared bonds among the residents of a house, and to better equip the residents to navigate the conflicts and differences of opinion which will inevitably arise.

The circle is led by a different resident every month, and takes place over dinner, which is organized by the resident leading the circle.

1. First, residents go around in a circle sharing personal **roses, thorns, and buds** for the month -- things which went well for them, things which did not, and things they are looking forward to in the future.

2. Then, residents go around in a circle sharing **positive things** which happened in the house and among the residents.

3. Then, residents go around in a circle sharing **concerns about the house** -- negative patterns or problematic developments. The goal here is less to criticize individuals and more to build a consensus around shared expectations.

  .. note::

      During this go-around, there is usually more back-and-forth to get clarity around issues and to discuss possible resolutions.
      It is recommended to solicit house thorns in advance, so that other housemates have time to prepare their thoughts and responses.

4. Finally, residents go around in a circle sharing general **hopes and aspirations for the future** -- personal goals, visions for the house, hopes for the development of current events more broadly.

5. At the end of the circle, a different resident volunteers to lead the next month's circle and sets the date.
