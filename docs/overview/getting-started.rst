Getting Started
===============

You can get started with Chore Wheel in less than twenty minutes.

1) Set up the workspace
-----------------------

If your community doesn't have a Slack workspace, it should `create one <https://slack.com/get-started#/createnew>`_ and invite people to join.

.. tip::

  Chore Wheel works equally well on free and paid Slack plans.


2) Set up the tools
-------------------

**Click the link below to install each tool into the workspace**

- `Install Chores ↗ <https://chores.mirror.zaratan.world/slack/install>`_
- `Install Hearts ↗ <https://hearts.mirror.zaratan.world/slack/install>`_
- `Install Things ↗ <https://things.mirror.zaratan.world/slack/install>`_

All tools function as stand-alone apps, but complement each other when used together.
There is a rough progression of power/complexity from using :ref:`chores` by itself, to combining it with :ref:`hearts`, to combining both with :ref:`things`.

When using :ref:`chores` as a stand-alone tool, you get all the power of the chore system, but without a long-term accountability structure.
By adding :ref:`hearts`, you get long-term accountability both for chores, and the ability to encourage and discourage specific behaviors.
By adding :ref:`things`, you get some simple tooling for managing shared funds, useful for larger groups.

The right mix of tools will depend on your specific needs.
**If you're just getting started**, try installing :ref:`chores` and :ref:`hearts`.

.. tip::

  If 100% of the workspace votes yes for a proposal, it **passes immediately**.
  This is useful if folks are gathered in-person and want to get up-and-running quickly.

.. warning::

  **It is normal if initially things are not making sense or working as you expect.**
  These tools are *dynamic*, so their state evolves over time.
  People also need time to try out the systems and learn how they work.
  It usually takes a few days for things to settle into a steady rhythm.
