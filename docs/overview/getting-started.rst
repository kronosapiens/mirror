Getting Started
===============

You can get started with Chore Wheel in less than twenty minutes.

1) Set up the workspace
-----------------------

If your community doesn't have a Slack workspace, it should `create one <https://slack.com/get-started#/createnew>`_ and invite people to join.

.. tip::

  Chore Wheel works equally well on **free** and **paid** Slack plans.


2) Install the tools
--------------------

**Click the link below to install each tool into the workspace**

- `Install Chores ↗ <https://chores.mirror.zaratan.world/slack/install>`_
- `Install Hearts ↗ <https://hearts.mirror.zaratan.world/slack/install>`_
- `Install Things ↗ <https://things.mirror.zaratan.world/slack/install>`_

When using :ref:`chores` as a stand-alone tool, you get all the power of the **chore system**, but without a long-term accountability structure.
By adding :ref:`hearts`, you get **long-term accountability** both for chores, and the ability to encourage and discourage specific behaviors.
By adding :ref:`things`, you get some simple tooling for **managing shared funds**, useful for larger groups.

The right mix of tools will depend on your specific needs.
**If you're just getting started**, try installing :ref:`chores` and :ref:`hearts`.

.. note::

  While Chore Wheel provides innovative tools for representing and distributing regenerative labor, it does not create buy-in automatically.
  For communities to succeed with Chore Wheel, they need to establish some amount of **commitment** and **accountability** to the process.

.. warning::

  **It is normal if initially things are not making sense or working as you expect.**
  These tools are *dynamic*, so their state evolves over time.
  People also need time to try out the systems and learn how they work.
  It usually takes a few days for things to settle into a steady rhythm.
