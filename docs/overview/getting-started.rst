Getting Started
===============

Getting started with Chore Wheel is quick and easy, and you can be up-and-running in twenty minutes.

.. tip::

  It is recommended that everyone be physically present during the set-up process.
  Perhaps over brunch?

Setting up the workspace
------------------------

First, designate one person to be the **coordinator** for the process.
If the house already has a Slack workspace, they should be one of the `admins <https://slack.com/help/articles/360018112273-Types-of-roles-in-Slack>`_.
If the house doesn't have a Slack workspace, they should `create one <https://slack.com/get-started#/createnew>`_ now.
Chore Wheel works equally well on free and paid Slack plans.

.. note::

  One of the design principles of Chore Wheel is "no managers or privileged roles."
  In practice, allowing a small number of privileged actions makes a few things much easier.
  These actions are available to **any admin** in the workspace.
  If your community would prefer that everyone can take these actions, they should make everyone an admin.

Once your house has a Slack workspace, please invite everyone to join, and wait for them to accept their invites.

Setting up the tools
--------------------

Once everyone has join the workspace, you can begin installing the tools.
Once you install each tool, the `app home <https://api.slack.com/surfaces/app-home>`_ page will give you specific instructions on getting up-and-running.

- `Install Chores <https://chores.mirror.zaratan.world/slack/install>`_
- `Install Hearts <https://hearts.mirror.zaratan.world/slack/install>`_
- `Install Things <https://things.mirror.zaratan.world/slack/install>`_

All tools function as stand-alone apps, but complement each other when used together.
There is a rough progression of power/complexity from using :ref:`chores` by itself, to combining it with :ref:`hearts`, to combining both with :ref:`things`.

When using :ref:`chores` as a stand-alone tool, you get all the power of the chore system, but without a long-term accountability structure.
By adding :ref:`hearts`, you get long-term accountability both for chores, and the ability to encourage and discourage specific behaviors.
By adding :ref:`things`, you get some simple tooling for managing shared funds, useful for larger groups.

The right mix of tools will depend on your specific needs. If you're just exploring, try getting started with :ref:`chores` and :ref:`hearts`.

.. tip::

  If 100% of the workspace votes yes for a proposal, it **passes immediately**.
  This is useful if folks are gathered in-person and want to get up-and-running quickly.

.. warning::

  **It is normal if initially things are not making sense or working as you expect.**
  These tools are *dynamic*, so their state evolves over time.
  People also need time to try out the systems and learn how they work.
  It usually takes a few days for things to settle into a steady rhythm.
