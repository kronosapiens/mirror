Introduction
============

As housing costs continue to climb, the development of quality, affordable housing remains a continual challenge.
It is increasingly apparent that **coliving** - housing options where residents have private bedrooms but share common spaces like kitchens, bathrooms, and living rooms - is an important part of the solution.

.. note::

  While initially designed for large coliving houses, Chore Wheel works just as well helping groups of friends or even couples navigate shared space.

Perhaps the greatest benefit of coliving is the avoidance of redundant infrastructure (e.g. one large kitchen, rather than three small ones), which lowers costs.
However, sharing common resources introduces new coordination challenges (e.g. “who does the dishes”).
Historically, such challenges have been overcome through informal norms (e.g. a “dish-zero” rule), deliberative decision-making processes (e.g. house meetings), or basic coordination mechanisms (e.g. white-board chore schedules).
Such solutions are unreliable, burdensome, and often too simplistic to meet the needs of a large and varied population.

As Oscar Wilde famously quipped, “the trouble with socialism is that it takes up too many evenings.” **We can do better.**

Chore Wheel is *poetic technology*: a family of tools meant to support the healthy functioning of a coliving environment, **by maximizing participation and minimizing dysfunction**.
By helping coliving communities handle their most common problems almost "by magic," Chore Wheel lets people channel their time and energy towards more long-term, meaningful projects.

.. note::

  Note that Chore Wheel does not claim to capture all ideation, decision making, and deliberation occuring in a coliving environment.
  Nor does its use reduce the need for :ref:`ongoing investments <monthly-circle>` in community-building.
  Rather, it takes its cue from the Pareto principle: a set of simple, general tools which handles the most common 80% of scenarios, leaving the remaining 20% to be handled by people on their own.
