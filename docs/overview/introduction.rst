Introduction
============

As housing costs continue to climb, the development of quality, affordable housing remains a continual challenge.
It is increasingly apparent that **coliving** - housing options where residents have private bedrooms but share common spaces like kitchens, bathrooms, and living rooms - is an important part of the solution.

.. note::

  While initially designed for large coliving houses, Mirror works just as well helping groups of friends or even couples navigate shared space.

Perhaps the greatest benefit of coliving is the avoidance of redundant infrastructure (e.g. one large kitchen, rather than three small ones), which lowers costs.
However, sharing common resources introduces new coordination challenges (e.g. “who does the dishes”).
Historically, such challenges have been overcome through informal norms (e.g. a “dish-zero” rule), deliberative decision-making processes (e.g. house meetings), or basic coordination mechanisms (e.g. white-board chore schedules).
Such solutions are unreliable, burdensome, and often too simplistic to meet the needs of a large and varied population.

As Oscar Wilde famously quipped, “the trouble with socialism is that it takes up too many evenings.” **We can do better.**

Mirror is *poetic technology*: a family of tools meant to support the healthy functioning of a coliving environment, **by maximizing participation and minimizing potential abuses of power**.
Drawing influences variously from cognitive science, computer science, electoral theory, economics, cybernetics, and game design, it functions with four top-level design goals:

- No managers or privileged administrative roles
- Simple and intuitive inputs
- Humans for sensing and judgment, machines for bookkeeping
- Continuously available, asynchronous processes

Although these design principles can be desirable in many settings, we see the coliving setting as having the **greatest potential for benefit**.
For example, and by contrast, a government workplace would likely also benefit from simple and intuitive inputs, making it easier for employees to meaningfully participate.
But the work done there, being *linear* (i.e. novel, creative) in nature, makes flat organization significantly riskier and more challenging.
In a housing environment, on the other hand, much of the work is *cyclical* (i.e. continuous, repetitious, not meaningfully different between iterations), allowing for new approaches which de-emphasize novel ideation and emphasize resource balancing and mutual accountability.

Further, unlike the distributed and anonymous settings of online communities, coliving environments, being real physical spaces, provide many more opportunities for the informal, casual interactions necessary for building strong relationships.
As such, we can *assume* the existence of a coherent social sphere, with the software tools merely providing a structure for transparency and accountability.

Note that Mirror does not claim to capture all ideation, decision making, and deliberation occuring in a coliving environment.
Nor does its use reduce the need for ongoing investments in community-building.
Rather, it takes its cue from the Pareto principle: a set of simple, general tools which handles the most common 80% of scenarios, leaving the remaining 20% to be handled by separate, specialized processes.


By helping coliving communities handle their most common problems almost "by magic", Mirror lets communities channel their time and energy towards more long-term, meaningful projects.
