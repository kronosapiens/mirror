Mirror is self-governance software for coliving, influenced by economics, game design, and lived experience.

Developed in collaboration with social scientists and game designers, Mirror is a set of tools and processes which enable groups of individuals to easily and effectively manage shared space, without reliance on expensive managers or tedious meetings. The term "Mirror" is meant to evoke the extent to which these tools do not prescribe values, but rather support the reflection of the values of the residents themselves.

The developers have drawn major influence from the work of Elinor Ostrom, and attempt to design in line with her [eight principles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elinor_Ostrom#Design_principles_for_Common_Pool_Resource_(CPR)_institution):

1. Clearly defined the group boundaries (and effective exclusion of external un-entitled parties) and the contents of the common pool resource;
2. The appropriation and provision of common resources that are adapted to local conditions;
3. Collective-choice arrangements that allow most resource appropriators to participate in the decision-making process;
4. Effective monitoring by monitors who are part of or accountable to the appropriators;
5. A scale of graduated sanctions for resource appropriators who violate community rules;
6. Mechanisms of conflict resolution that are cheap and of easy access;
7. Self-determination of the community recognized by higher-level authorities; and
8. In the case of larger common-pool resources, organization in the form of multiple layers of nested enterprises, with small local CPRs at the base level.

Leveraging the simple and accessible chat interface, Mirror enables meaningful self-governance in a lightweight, accessible format. Grounded in current technological critiques, Mirror is humble and intentional in its use of tech, attempting to balance software with culture and documented best practices.
