Mirror is pioneering governance software, heavily influenced by economics, game design, and lived experience.

Developed in collaboration with social scientists and game designers, Mirror is a set of tools and processes which enable groups of individuals to easily and effectively share space. The term "Mirror" is meant to evoke the extent to which these tools do not prescribe values, but rather support the reflection of the values of the residents themselves.

Mirror helps groups to manage resources and negotiate expectations without relying on expensive managers or tedious meetings. Leveraging the simple and accessible chat interface, Mirror enables meaningful self-governance in a lightweight, accessible format. Grounded in current technological critiques, Mirror is humble and intentional in its use of tech, attempting to balance software with culture and documented best practices.

Mirror is currently being developed as a prototype, and will evolve in practice in collaboration with early Zaratan members. The long-term vision is a set of tools which allows housing communities to quickly establish effective internal rhythms, without an excessive reliance on the leadership of individuals.
