# Mirror ðŸªž

Mirror is the internal operating model for [Zaratan](https://zaratan.world).

Developed in collaboration with social scientists and game designers, Mirror is a set of tools and
processes which enable groups of individuals to easily and effectively share space.

Pioneering in it's design and goals, Mirror helps groups to manage resources and negotiate expectations
without relying on expensive managers or tedious meetings. Leveraging the simple and accessible chat interface,
Mirror enables meaningful self-governance in a lightweight, accessible format.

Grounded in current technological critiques, Mirror is humble and intentional in its use of tech,
attempting to balance software with culture and documented best practices.

Mirror is currently being developed as a prototype, and will likely evolve once put into practice,
in collaboration with early Zaratan members. The long-term vision is the creation of a set of
tools which allows housing communities to quickly establish effective internal rhythms, without
relying on singularly capable individuals.
